Sprite editor for QuickBasic\C Turbo Pascal\C

30 years ago i wrote a small uility in Turbo Pascal (DOS) that would allow me to create simple sprites/icons and generate code. I have always wanted to do a port of this utility to Windows and provide some updates. I may be the slowest programmer in the world but i have managed to get the hard parts completed. I am working on touching up the user interface. In a few days there should be something here.

It turns out i was l little too optimistic - it might take me a little longer than a few days. I've decided to start commiting changes for some of the code. When it is mostly ported i will commit everything.

I have managed to Port 90% of the program features. I also managed to include some features not in the original. There are a few main pieces of code that have hard paths. Cleaning up code so that it can be compiled on other systems. Not cleaning up to make pretty!
